# Mongo-Notion Sync

A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) plugin for [Notion](https://notion.so/) that syncs entries between your Notion and your local MongoDB.

This is specifically written for me so I can use it to sync my mongodb book library to my notion book library. It's not meant to be a general purpose sync plugin.
